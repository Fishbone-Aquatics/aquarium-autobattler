# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Architecture Overview

This is an **Nx monorepo** containing a full-stack aquarium auto-battler game:

- **frontend/** - Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript frontend with Tailwind CSS
- **game-engine/** - NestJS backend with WebSocket real-time communication
- **libs/shared-types/** - Shared TypeScript interfaces for type safety across frontend/backend
- **PowerShell scripts** - `start.ps1` and `stop.ps1` for Windows development workflow

### Key Technologies
- **Nx workspace** for monorepo management and coordinated builds
- **WebSocket (Socket.IO)** for real-time multiplayer game state
- **In-memory session storage** for game state (no database required)
- **Drag & Drop HTML5 API** for game piece placement

## Development Commands

### Starting/Stopping Services
```bash
# Windows PowerShell (preferred)
./start.ps1                    # Start both services with colored output
./stop.ps1                     # Stop services on ports 3000/3001

# Manual start
npm run dev                    # Start both frontend + backend
npm run start:frontend         # Next.js dev server (port 3000)
npm run start:backend          # NestJS server (port 3001)

# Individual Nx commands  
npx nx dev frontend            # Frontend only
npx nx serve game-engine       # Backend only
```

### Building
```bash
npm run build:shared          # Build shared types library first
npm run build:all             # Build shared types + game-engine + frontend
npx nx build shared-types      # Build shared library
npx nx build game-engine       # Build NestJS backend
npx nx build frontend          # Build Next.js frontend
```

### Testing & Quality
```bash
npm run test:comprehensive     # Custom integration test suite (test-setup.js)
npm run test:unit              # All unit tests
npm run test:e2e               # E2E tests with Playwright
npx nx test                    # Run all Jest tests
npx nx test --watch            # Watch mode for tests
npm run lint                   # Lint all projects
npm run lint:fix               # Auto-fix linting issues
```

## Game Engine Architecture (NestJS)

The backend follows a clean service-oriented architecture with dedicated services for different game domains:

### Core Services (Refactored 2025-08-10)
- **src/game/game.service.ts** - Game orchestration, session management, WebSocket endpoints (710 lines)
- **src/tank/tank.service.ts** - Tank operations, piece placement, water quality, adjacency bonuses (~400 lines)
- **src/battle/battle.service.ts** - Combat mechanics, battle simulation, turn processing (~300 lines) 
- **src/economy/economy.service.ts** - Shop generation, gold rewards, interest calculation (~250 lines)
- **src/ai/ai.service.ts** - Opponent behavior, tank management, smart AI logic (~200 lines)
- **src/player/player.service.ts** - Session persistence, player state management (existing)

### Supporting Modules
- **src/debug/** - Debug endpoints, admin tools, API documentation  
- **src/app/data/pieces.ts** - Game piece definitions and stats

### Service Dependencies
```typescript
GameService
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PlayerService (session management)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TankService (grid operations, water quality) 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BattleService (combat, turn processing)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EconomyService (shop, gold, interest)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AIService (opponent logic)
```

### Architecture Benefits
- ‚úÖ **Proper NestJS dependency injection** - Clean service boundaries
- ‚úÖ **Separation of concerns** - Each service handles one domain  
- ‚úÖ **Maintainable code** - 65% reduction in GameService size
- ‚úÖ **Type safety** - All services use shared-types interfaces
- ‚úÖ **Testable** - Services can be unit tested independently

### WebSocket Events
Game state synchronization uses Socket.IO events defined in `libs/shared-types/src/lib/events.types.ts`.

## Frontend Architecture (Next.js)

- **src/app/** - Next.js App Router pages and API routes
- **src/components/game/** - Game-specific React components (GameView, Shop, TankGrid, BattleView)
- **src/components/ui/** - Reusable UI components  
- **src/contexts/GameContext.tsx** - React context for game state management
- **src/utils/** - Game logic utilities and calculations

### Key Components
- **GameView** - Main game interface orchestration
- **TankGrid** - 8√ó6 grid drag-and-drop piece placement  
- **Shop** - Piece purchasing, reroll mechanics, gold management
- **BattleView** - Real-time combat visualization

## Game Mechanics Context

Understanding the game helps when debugging or adding features:

- **8√ó6 tank grid** with complex multi-cell piece shapes
- **4 piece types**: Fish (attackers), Plants (buffers), Equipment (utility), Consumables (permanent buffs)
- **Adjacency bonuses** - pieces affect neighbors with stat bonuses
- **Real-time battles** with speed-based initiative order
- **Session persistence** - game state survives page refreshes

## Recent Major Features 

### Architecture Refactoring (2025-08-10) üèóÔ∏è
- **Complete GameService Refactoring** - Extracted monolithic ~2000 line service into clean architecture
- **Service Extraction Process**:
  - **Phase 1**: AIService extraction (~200 lines)
  - **Phase 2**: BattleService extraction (~300 lines)
  - **Phase 3**: Integration tests and safety validation

- **Economy Balance** - Simplified streak bonuses, proper transaction logging

## Known Issues & Priorities

See TODO.md for current priorities.

## Common Build Issues & Solutions

### TypeScript Errors
- **Missing properties**: Check shared-types interfaces match usage (e.g., `totalPower` ‚Üí use `totalAttack + totalHealth`)
- **Import/Export mismatches**: Ensure all exports from shared-types are properly imported

### JSX Structure Errors
- **Unclosed tags**: Watch for dangling `</>` or mismatched conditional rendering
- **Component nesting**: Ensure proper `{ condition && (<>...</>)}` structure

### Service Architecture Patterns
- **GameService**: Only handles orchestration, WebSocket endpoints, and complex business logic spanning multiple domains
- **Service method calls**: Always use dependency injection (e.g., `this.tankService.calculateWaterQuality()`)
- **Avoid duplication**: If logic exists in a service, don't reimplement in GameService
- **Type safety**: All services use shared-types interfaces consistently
- **Service boundaries**: Each service should handle one clear domain (tank, battle, economy, etc.)

### Service Quick Reference
```typescript
// Tank operations
this.tankService.updateTankPiece(tank, pieceId, position, action)
this.tankService.calculateWaterQuality(tank)
this.tankService.calculatePieceStats(piece, allPieces)
this.tankService.processConsumables(tank)

// Battle mechanics  
this.battleService.initializeBattleState(gameState, statsCalculator)
this.battleService.processBattleTurn(battleState, waterQuality)
this.battleService.simulateBattle(playerTank, opponentTank)

// Economy operations
this.economyService.generateShop(existingShop?, lockedIndex?)
this.economyService.calculateRerollCost(currentRerolls)
this.economyService.calculateGoldReward(isWinner)

// AI behavior
this.aiService.updateOpponentTank(gameState, callbacks...)
this.aiService.generateOpponentPieces(budget, currentPieces)
```

### Adjacency Logic Debugging
- **Multi-cell pieces**: Use `TankService.areTwoPiecesAdjacent()` for proper shape-aware adjacency
- **Bonus stacking**: Ensure each piece gets only one bonus per source
- **Equipment effects**: Current system only affects water quality, not adjacency bonuses

### Mobile UI Patterns
- **Collapsible sections**: Use `useState` + conditional rendering for mobile-friendly progressive disclosure
- **Info icons**: Use ‚ÑπÔ∏è with hover (desktop) + tap (mobile) for detailed information
- **Button hierarchy**: Primary actions first (especially on mobile), secondary details collapsible

## Testing Strategy

Run comprehensive tests with `npm run test:comprehensive` which validates:
- Backend API health (port 3001)
- Frontend loading (port 3000) 
- WebSocket connectivity
- CSS compilation with Tailwind
- Component file presence
- Development dependencies

### Build Commands for Error Checking
```bash
npm run build:shared          # Always build shared types first
npm run build:all             # Full build to catch all errors
npx nx build frontend         # Frontend-specific TypeScript/JSX errors
npx nx build game-engine      # Backend-specific errors
