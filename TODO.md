# üê† Aquarium Auto-Battler - Development TODO

## üî¥ Critical Issues (Must Fix)

*All critical issues have been resolved! üéâ*

---

## üü° High Impact Features

### 1. Player Grid Logging System
- **Issue**: Need to collect player tank builds for future opponent matching
- **Impact**: Currently using AI opponents only, limiting strategic variety
- **Solution**: Log player grids/builds between rounds to temp table, queryable via API for faux opponents in "ranked" battles
- **Files**: `game.service.ts`, new debug endpoint, database/temp storage
- **Goal**: Enable real player builds as opponents instead of just AI strategies

### 2. Opponent AI Improvements
- **Issue**: AI hoards gold (sitting on 50g with losing streak), poor purchasing decisions
- **Impact**: Battles become too easy, poor game balance  
- **Solution**: Implement smarter AI that considers gold efficiency, loss streaks, and power spikes
- **Files**: `game.service.ts` - `updateOpponentTank()` method

### 3. Gold Transaction Tracker
- **Issue**: No visibility into gold income/expense sources
- **Impact**: Hard to understand economy, plan strategies
- **Solution**: Create detailed gold history UI showing all transactions
- **Files**: `GameView.tsx`, `Footer.tsx` or new component

### 4. Equipment System Expansion
- **Issue**: Only Basic Filter exists, equipment underutilized  
- **Impact**: Limited strategic options, equipment feels pointless
- **Solution**: Add more equipment types with diverse effects
- **Files**: `pieces.ts`, `game.service.ts`, equipment effect system

---

## üîµ Medium Priority Fixes

### 5. Equipment Respawn Issue
- **Issue**: Equipment doesn't respawn after battles (only fish/plants do)
- **Impact**: Equipment permanently lost after battle
- **Solution**: Include equipment in respawn logic
- **Files**: `game.service.ts` - `respawnPieces()` method

### 6. Missing Items Investigation
- **Issue**: Some items seem missing from original piece library
- **Impact**: Reduced content variety
- **Solution**: Audit piece library, compare with design docs, add missing pieces
- **Files**: `pieces.ts`

### 7. Adjacency Bonus Tooltips
- **Issue**: Tooltips don't show specific stat values from adjacency bonuses
- **Impact**: Players can't see exact bonus amounts (+1 ATK, +2 HP, etc.)
- **Solution**: Display numeric values in bonus descriptions
- **Files**: `GameView.tsx`, `TankGrid.tsx` - tooltip sections

---

## üü¢ Low Priority Polish

### 8. Battle Log UI Enhancement
- **Issue**: Log section is tiny and hard to read
- **Impact**: Poor UX for following combat details
- **Solution**: Expand log area, better formatting, scroll controls
- **Files**: `BattleView.tsx`

### 9. Reset Game Shop Bug
- **Issue**: Clicking Reset Game doesn't regenerate shop (requires 2g reroll)
- **Impact**: Minor UX annoyance for new players
- **Solution**: Auto-regenerate shop when clicking Reset Game.
- **Files**: `Footer.tsx`, `game.service.ts`

### 10. Water Quality Not Working
- **Issue**: Water quality doesn't affect piece performance despite being tracked
- **Impact**: Game mechanic completely non-functional, reduces strategic depth
- **Solution**: Verify water quality bonuses are applied in battle calculations and adjacency effects
- **Files**: `game.service.ts`, `calculatePieceStats()`, battle system

### 11. Reroll Cost Scaling
- **Issue**: Need to verify if reroll cost increases after X rerolls or rounds
- **Impact**: Unknown if economy balancing mechanic is working
- **Solution**: Check if reroll cost properly scales (2g ‚Üí 4g ‚Üí 6g etc.) and implement if missing
- **Files**: `Shop.tsx`, `game.service.ts`, reroll logic

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

### Regression Testing Needed
- [ ] **Multi-cell Adjacency**: Verify all complex shapes work correctly
- [ ] **Equipment Effects**: Test filter +20% boost with various plant combinations  
- [ ] **Battle Logic**: Ensure dead fish can't attack (recent fix)
- [ ] **Consumable Bonuses**: Verify permanent bonuses persist through respawns
- [ ] **Session Management**: Test save/restore, reset game, new ID flows

### Performance Testing
- [ ] **Large Battles**: Test with many pieces, complex adjacencies
- [ ] **WebSocket Stress**: Multiple concurrent battles
- [ ] **Memory Leaks**: Long game sessions, repeated battles

### Cross-browser Testing
- [ ] **Chrome, Firefox, Safari**: Core gameplay
- [ ] **Mobile**: Touch drag-and-drop, responsive design
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Screen readers, keyboard navigation

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Advanced Features
- **Tournament Mode**: Bracket-style multi-player competitions
- **Piece Upgrade System**: Evolve pieces with repeated purchases  
- **Special Abilities**: Active abilities triggered manually
- **Environmental Effects**: Different tank biomes with unique bonuses
- **Deck Building**: Pre-constructed teams vs random shop

### Technical Improvements  
- **Database Persistence**: Replace in-memory state with database
- **Replay System**: Save and replay interesting battles
- **Statistics Tracking**: Win rates, favorite pieces, meta analysis
- **Spectator Mode**: Watch other players' battles
- **Mobile App**: Native iOS/Android versions
